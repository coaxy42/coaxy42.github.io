			  This Project was my first dealing with a client, the client who is a published author asked for a twitter logo designed for their twitter and facebook account. The client sent me a few ideas of what they wanted. I Made the ideas that the client watned but also made a few of my own ideas. I sent the client all the logos I made and asked which they liked most and what changed they would like made if any. The client sent back one of my own logo designs and asked for a few changes which were made easily.
